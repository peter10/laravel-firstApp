I wanted to see how Laravel is put together so I made this app as an exercise. It's a simple CRUD app with two models and a pivot table, the most interesting file will be the [User Controller](controllers/UserController.php). You can see it on my [website](http://superawesome.biz/laravel) but you'll have to [register](http://superawesome.biz/laravel/users/register) before you create or delete anything.

I instantly became a huge fan, Laravel is a pleasure to work with.
